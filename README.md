# NLP_Text_Classification
Using a Kaggle Playground data to implement ML and DL techniques and further drawing comparisons.

# Purpose
Natural language processing has been widely popular, with the large amount of data available (in emails, web pages, sms) it becomes important to extract valuable information from textual data. There are an assortment of machine learning techniques designed to accomplish this task. With current advances in deep learning, we felt it would be an interesting idea to compare traditional and deep learning techniques. We decided to pick up a playground kaggle dataset with the purpose of text classification and proceeded to implement both these types of algorithms for comparison purposes. 


### Problem 
In todayâ€™s world, websites have to deal with toxic and divisive content. Especially major websites like Quora which cater to large traffic and their purpose is to provide a platform to people for asking and answering questions. A key challenge is to weed out insincere questions, those founded upon false premises or questions that intend to make a statement rather than look for helpful answers.
